Remove the right-side workspace thumbnails sidebar from the Activities overview. Perfect if you don't use workspaces.

Remove Workspaces Sidebar @ **[Gnome Extensions](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/387/remove-workspaces-sidebar/)** | **[GitHub](https://github.com/jancborchardt/gnome-shell-extensions)**


## Other Extensions I like

Even though I love GNOME Shell, there are some things which need to be improved. These are other extensions I use where Shell design can also take hints from:

* **[Maximus](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/354/maximus/)**: Remove the title bar on maximized windows. Because it's just too much space for a close button and duplicating the app name. Rather, the close button should be in the menu bar line.
* **[WindowOverlay Icons](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/302/windowoverlay-icons/)**: Makes it easier to distinguish windows by adding their icon.
* **[Windows Alt Tab](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/38/windows-alt-tab/)**: Because grouping windows by app makes 0 sense.
* **[Quit Button](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/156/quit-button/)**: I know my name, no need to show it to me all the time.
* **[Nothing To Do](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/153/nothingtodo/)**: If I don't use the calendar agenda, just don't show it.
* **[Remove Accessibility](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/112/remove-accesibility/)**: Don’t need the functions in it and it’s one indicator less.
