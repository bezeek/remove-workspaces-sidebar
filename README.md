# GNOME Shell Extensions
by [Jan-Christoph Borchardt](http://jancborchardt.net)

Some extensions for the great [GNOME Shell](http://gnome.org). They are highly opinionated and really not for everyone, although the Shell design could take hints from them. Keep in mind I mostly use the browser and need the desktop to get out of my way.

* **[Distraction-Free](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/393/distraction-free/)**: Show Panel and Message Tray only in the Activities overview. Also removes the hot corner so it's not triggered by accident. Switch to Activities with the Super key or cycle apps with Alt+Tab.
* **[Remove Workspaces Sidebar](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/387/remove-workspaces-sidebar/)**: Remove the right-side workspace thumbnails sidebar from the Activities overview. Perfect if you don't use workspaces.


## Other Extensions I like

Even though I love GNOME Shell, there are some things which need to be improved. These are other extensions I use where Shell design can also take hints from:

* **[Maximus](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/354/maximus/)**: Remove the title bar on maximized windows. Because it's just too much space for a close button and duplicating the app name. Rather, the close button should be in the menu bar line.
* **[WindowOverlay Icons](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/302/windowoverlay-icons/)**: Makes it easier to distinguish windows by adding their icon.
* **[Windows Alt Tab](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/38/windows-alt-tab/)**: Because grouping windows by app makes 0 sense.
* **[Quit Button](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/156/quit-button/)**: I know my name, no need to show it to me all the time.
* **[Nothing To Do](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/153/nothingtodo/)**: If I don't use the calendar agenda, just don't show it.
* **[Remove Accessibility](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/112/remove-accesibility/)**: Don’t need the functions in it and it’s one indicator less.
