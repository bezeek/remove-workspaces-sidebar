# Remove Workspaces Sidebar

A [Gnome Shell extension](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/387/remove-workspaces-sidebar/) to remove the right-side workspace thumbnails sidebar from the Activities overview. Perfect if you don't use workspaces.


## Installation

Until the extension is approved and available online on the [Gnome extension platform](http://extensions.gnome.org/extension/387/remove-workspaces-sidebar/), you can install it manually:

1. Go to the directory _~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions_
2. Create a new folder _remove-workspaces-sidebar@jancborchardt.net_
3. Put these files in there. That's it. (Maybe you need to enable the extension by installing gnome-tweak-tool.)
